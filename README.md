# spinAdvection - VTK-m Spin Trajectory Solver

⚠️ **Warning:** This repository is still under development.

Its current purpose is to share the VTK-m files responsible for computing particle trajectories based on fluid field files in `.vtk`, `.vtu`, `.vti`, and related formats.

Note that the actual fluid field files are **not included** in this repository, as they are too large to be stored here.
